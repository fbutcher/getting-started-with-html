<!--The <html> element is the document root. It is the recommended place for displaying the page language-->
<!-- Learned that this is how I can leave notes to myself by looking at Andy's Codepen page. -->
<!-- The <head> element displays information that will not be seen on the actual page. It contains meta data (data about data).-->
<!--Meta data typically define document title, styles, links, scripts and other meta information -->

  <!-- The <title> element normally sets the name of the browser tab but (when you work in codepen, codepen's title overrides that -->

<!-- The <h1> tag means "heading 1" Heading tags can go up to <h6>. Lower number heading tags indicate page headings that are more important.--> 
<h1><u>NOTES ON IMPORTANT CONCEPTS OF HTML</u></h1>

<b>The World Wide Web</b>
<p>The World Wide Web was created in the 1990's. It is host to approximately 30 billion web pages!
<br>The World Wide Web works by users accessing web pages through at browser. The browsers make requests and retrieves page data from web servers via HTTP "Hypertext Transfer Prototocol." <br>Servers are computers that store the data on the "backend." What the user sees via the browser is called the "frontend."

<b>HTML</b>

<p><em>HTML - hypertext markup language</em><br> HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. This is the language used to write most webpages and is used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript. <br> HTML is used to display the text of most webpages it is also good at linking images and other webpages. HTML uses tags or elements.  </p>





<b>Tags and Elements</b>

<p>HTML Markup uses tags to display hypertext on the web page the following are some examples of tags.
<br>
  <br>"br"--"/br" Allows the user to create a break to move text to the next line.
    <br>"p"--"/p" A new paragraph is started
      <br>"em"--"/em" Italics text
        <br>"b"--"/b" To bold text</br>
</p>
<p><em>It is important to note that each tag is within angel brackets instead of quotes.</em></p>
<br> A visual example of how tags work can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=21&v=VsxbuJWcxqA">here</a>
  
</p>

<b>Inline vs. Block</b>

<p>Block elements create an invisble box within the tags. An example of a block element would be the "p" "/p" tags.
  <br>Inline elements such as the "br""/br" tag simply wrap text to the next line. 
</p>

<b>Computers And Programming</b>

<p>Computers are unable to execute any task on their own.  They rely on the user to input instructions before any task can be executed.<br> For this reason, computers are very unforgiving if the instructions, i.e. the code is not clear and exact. Bad code can result in many hours of problem solving. </p>
<p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer writes.</p>
